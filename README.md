The objective of the machine learning project was to develop a predictive model that forecasted students' future academic scores based on their historical academic performance and relevant features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, we aimed to create a robust model capable of accurately predicting students' academic performance. The model achieved an accuracy of 96%
